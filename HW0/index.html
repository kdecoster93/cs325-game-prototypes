<h2>Astroblast!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li> Astroblast is a top down shooter style game that boasts realistic space flight as a game mechanic. Every movement made in space must
    be accompanied by an equal and opposite reaction in order to regain composure. Fight a teleporting alien enemy to increase your score
    and try to master the art of space combat!</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>Astroblast utilizes top down shooter technology that allows a player to  aim and shoot in a 360 degree range around them. The game
    utilizes the same shooting mechanics for its titular alien enemy that relentless attempts to destroy the player. The most important
    technology however is focused on fine tuning the movement controls to react appropriately to the players in game velocity and 
    acceleration. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<ul>
<li>1. I learned how to properly assign movement controls to movement actions on screen
    2. I learned how to create a "game over" event.
    3. I learned how to properly use text, audio, sprites, and sprite animation.
    4. I learned how to setup an environment for a game and set the locations of in game assets.</li>
</ul>
    
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>The hardest part in the process of making this game was trying to figure out how to properly make realistic space flight controls.
    Unlike a lot of other games that only require you to set the velocity upon a keydown and upon a keyup set it back to 0, Astroblast
    requires me to program with acceleration and drifting. I had to play around with a lot of movement programming to reach an 
    acceptable state of feeling.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li> My game most closely resembles the phaser example "Top Down Shooter". I borrowed the template code from this example to get a head start
    on my game and attempt to decipher how movement, shooting, and targeting work in such a game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
<li>Astroblast is a top down space shooter where you must learn to master the harsh realities of space flight to fight the alien menace
    pursuing you and increase your score for as long as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
    N/A according to instructor
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>The main inspiration and play style derives from games such as Asteroids, Galaga, and FTL. I wanted to take the concepts of Sci Fi
    space shooters and apply a more realistic feel to the controls and freedom of movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>The game mechanic this prototype is evaluating is the flight and shooting mechanics.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>I want players to feel on the edge of their seat as they narrowly dodge laser fire from an alien ship. The player should feel as
    if mastering movement is an integral part of the game and required to survive for long periods of time.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>How to play: When you start the game you will use the WASD keys to move your spaceship around the level. To your left there will be 
    an enemy alien ship firing laser beams at you. You only have three health bars that do not regenerate so if the alien hits you
    three times then the game will end. You the movement keys to dart around the alien ship and left click the mouse on or towards the 
    alien's direction to damage him. Upon doing enough damage, your score will increase and the alien will be forced to teleport to a
    random location of his choice to begin shooting at you again. Survive for as long as possible to increase your score.</li>
</ul> 
    Controls: 
        Movement Keys: WASD
        Laser Fire: Left Mouse click
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>An effective strategy for achieving a high score in this game is to keep your distance from the alien ship and use as many bullets
    as possible to hit the alien from far ranges. The player is given an infinite stock of ammo so they should feel free to spend as much
    ammunition as possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
<li>Commmander Smiley is lost in space. After escaping a hostile world known only as Squibulon Prime, Commander Smiley now drifts 
    aimlessly in space seeking any sign of life. In an unfortunate turn of events, he makes contact with a rogue alien craft with 
    teleportation abilities. Commander Smiley must use all his space faring knowledge to survive the encounter with this most deadly
    craft.</li>
</ul>
